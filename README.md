minimalKB
=========

minimalKB is a SQLite-backed minimalistic knowledge base, initially designed
for robots (in particular human-robot interaction or multi-robot interaction).

It stores triples (like RDF/OWL triples), and provides a mostly conformant
[KB-API](http://homepages.laas.fr/slemaign/wiki/doku.php?id=kb_api_robotics)
API accessible via a simple socket protocol.

[pykb](https://github.com/severin-lemaignan/pykb) provides an idiomatic Python
binding, making easy to integrate the knowledge base in your applications.

It has almost no features, except it is fast and simple. Basic RDFS reasoning
is provided (cf below for details).

Written in Python. The only required dependency is `sqlite3`. If `rdflib` is
also available, you can easily import existing ontologies in RDF/OWL/n3/Turtle
formats in the knowledge base.

Installation
------------

```
$ git clone https://github.com/severin-lemaignan/minimalkb.git
$ cd minimalkb
$ python setup.py install
$ minimalkb
```

Run `minimalkb --help` for available options.

Features
--------

### Server-Client or embedded

`minimalKB` can be run as a stand-alone (socket) server, or directly embedded
in Python applications.

### Multi-models

`minimalKB` is intended for dynamic environments, with possibly several
contexts/agents requiring separate knowledge models.

New models can be created at any time and each operation (like knowledge
addition/retractation/query) can operate on a specific subset of models.

Each models are also independently classified by the reasoner.

### Event system

`minimalKB` provides a mechanism to *subscribe* to some conditions (like: an
instance of a given type is added to the knowledge base, some statement becomes
true, etc.) and get notified back.

### Reasoning

`minimalKB` only provides basic RDFS/OWL reasoning capabilities:

- it honors the transitive closure of the `rdfs:subClassOf` relation.
- functional predicates (child of `owl:functionalProperty`) are properly
  handled when updating the model (ie, if `<S P O>` is asserted with `P` a
  functional predicate, updating the model with `<S P O'>` will first cause `<S
  P O>` to be retracted).
- `owl:equivalentClass` is properly handled.

The reasoner runs in its own thread, and classify the model at a given rate, by
default 5Hz. It is thus needed to wait ~200ms before the results of the
classification become visible in the model.

### Transient knowledge

`minimalKB` allows to attach 'lifespans' to statements: after a given duration,
they are automatically collected.

### Ontology walking

`minimalKB` exposes several methods to explore the different ontological models
of the knowledge base. It is compatible with the visualization tool
[oro-view](https://github.com/severin-lemaignan/oro-view).
